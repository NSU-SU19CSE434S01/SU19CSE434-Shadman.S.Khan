**Introduction:**

Selenium is a testing library through which unit testing of websites can be done. we used selenium to test various features of a website. The website that we tested is a trvael based website that has features like signup, login, search through destinations, book flights, hotels, cars etc. The goal of our project in to generate test cases which are written in Java and use selenium API to test them on website.



**Project Idea:**

The main idea of the project is to generate as many test cases as possible to test as many features as possible. Since I was given a timeframe of 4 weeks to complete the project as well as learn the use of Selenium.



**Technology:**

    - Selenium Webdriver
    - Java
    - Mozilla Firefox

**Description**

We tested the following features of the website

	- Load
	- Login
	- SignUp
	- Booking Confirmation
	- Remove a booking (admin side)

**Packages Used**

	- selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar
	- client-combined-3.141.59.jar
	- client-combined-3.141.59-sources.jar
	- geckodriver.exe
	- FireFox.exe

**Testing Description**

I tested the load capability of the website and generated a test case to test if the website loads properly. Since it is a demo website, some features of it might be missing. so, tested the part. For the next part of testing I decided to test the login fucntions. Since a website like this cannot work without having a proper database and backend codes to log a user in. so, that was the secondary test. other tests I did included SignUp Test , Booking Test and for backend testing I tested the delete booking features.
